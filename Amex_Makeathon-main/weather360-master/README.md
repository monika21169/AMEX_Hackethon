# WeatherApp

We're using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to get weather data on different cities. You'll need to get your own API Key from their website (for free) and add it as an environment variable in a `.env` file. We have a template available as `example.env`.

You'll be using React initially to build this. If you're new to React, check out the [website](https://reactjs.org) for some information on getting started! 

## Setting Up
